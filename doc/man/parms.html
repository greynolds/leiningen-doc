            <div class="p">
               Terminology: in keeping with standard Unix usage, we reserve the
               term <i class="i">option</i> for bits of state that control the behavior
               of software.  For example, many command line tools have a
               <q class="q">verbose</q> option that controls how much information the
               tool dumps the stdout/stderr as it executes.
               
            </div>
            <div class="p">
               In order to specify (or set) an option, the user must supply the
               appropriate <i class="i">parameter</i> as part of the command.
               Alternatively, software commonly accepts parameters stored in
               environment variables.  Yet a third alternative is to accept
               parameters specified in a configuration file.
               
            </div>
            <div class="p">
               In practice the distinction between options and parameters in
               this sense is overlooked or not even noticed in the first place,
               with no ill effect.  But for the sake of clarity, it is useful
               to respect the distinction when it comes to Leiningen.  There
               are two reasons for this.
               
            </div>
            <div class="p">
               First, Leiningen project files may contain parameters for any
               number of programs, each of which support different options.  So
               although it makes sense to think of the project map as a kind of
               configuration file, it is not like the configuration files
               specific to particular software packages.  For example, Jetty
               depends heavily on configuration files that are specific to
               Jetty; there is no reason to put anything in a Jetty
               configuration file that Jetty would not understand.  A Leiningen
               project map, by contrast, ordinarily will contain parameters for
               several different software components.
               
            </div>
            <div class="p">
               Second, Leiningen places no constraints on the representation of
               any option.  Since Leiningen is extensible via plugins, the most
               Leiningen can do is provide a means of associating a value with
               a key - a Clojure map.  It then becomes the responsibility of
               the plugin to correctly interpret the key-value pair (which we
               call a <i class="i">parameter</i>).  This means in particular that a
               plugin designer can choose parameter key and value names that
               are completely different than their corresponding options.
               
            </div>
            <div class="p">
               A simple example: the <code class="cmdname">java</code> command
               understands a <q class="q">max heap size</q> option, whose command line
               parameter is <code class="cmdname">-Xmx&lt;size&gt;</code>.  Leiningen does
               not directly support this as a configuration parameter, however;
               instead it has a <code class="cmdname">:jvm-opts</code> parameter, whose
               value can be any parameter <code class="cmdname">java</code> understands.
               So Leiningen must <i class="i">construct</i> the appropriate command line
               from the project map parameters.  Furthermore, it is possible to
               choose completely different names; for example, Leiningen could
               have used <q class="q">semantic</q> parameters; in this example, it could
               have supported a <code class="cmdname">:jvm-max-heap</code> parameter that
               takes a number in MB as a value; or, it could have used a nested
               map, e.g. <code class="cmdname">:jvm-opts {:heap {:max 512 :min 64}}</code>.
               
            </div>
            <div class="p">
               So for the sake of clarity we will always refer to the key-value
               pairs in the project map as <i class="i">parameters</i>, and refer to the
               software state controlled by such parameter
               A given parameter is not necessarily specific to a particular
               software component, whereas options are always
               software-specific.
