                  	well-organized and well-written document I have in mind, it
                  	might be possible to sell print copies and generate a few
                  	bucks for Mulgara.  The idea being that any profits from this
                  	document in any form will go toward development of Mulgara.
                  	For this to work, obviously, there must be only one version
                  	available.
